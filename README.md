# Weather App

Your goal is to create an single page web app that interfaces the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) to display weather information.

The initial project has been setup using Create React App for Typescript and includes helpful scripts to easily build and test the app.

The API documentation for the Weather API can be found [here](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/). You will need to [sign up](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx) for a free acount to get an API key needed for any API requests.

Utilize react hooks and as many functional components as needed to effectively meet the requirements. 

## Requirements  

1. Be able to look up and display the following current weather info for an arbitrary city:
	* Current temp
	* Current day high temp
	* Current day low temp
	* Current weather condition (Overcast, Raining, etc)
2. Make it look not bad
3. Write unit tests

## Nice to Haves

1. Add additional info/functionality using any of the various weather APIs available
2. Make it pretty 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn lint`

Runs eslint on any code files to catch potential errors or nonstandard code.
