# Weather App

I created a responsive web app that allows users to see the current and future weather provided by the [WeatherAPI](/www.weatherapi.com/docs/). I also used a [Geo Location API](https://geolocation-db.com/json/) to initiate what users first see. It obtains a user's IP address to showcase nearby weather. This project was created using React, Typescript, Context API, Axios, Date-fns, NodeJS, and MaterialUI. This is my first project, where I also integrated unit tests using Jest. 

I LOVE feedback, so please let me know how I could improve my coding skills and become a better programmer!


### LIVE Demo
The UI is responsive. Try it on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device

### Local Install

First, create an account with WeatherAPI and replace ${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY} with your own API Key

```bash
# open terminal

# cd into folder and install node modules
yarn install

# start project
yarn start

# now running on http://localhost:3000/
```
