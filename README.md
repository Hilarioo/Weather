# Weather App

I created a responsive web app that allows users to see the current and future weather provided by the WeatherAPI. I also used a Geo Location API to initiate what users first see. It obtains a user's IP address to showcase nearby weather. This project was created using React, Typescript, Context API, Axios, Fetcha, NodeJS, and MaterialUI. This is my first project, where I also integrated unit tests using Jest. 

I LOVE feedback, so please let me know how I could improve my coding skills and become a better programmer!

### Local Install

First, create an account with WeatherAPI and replace ${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY} with your own API

```bash
# open terminal

# cd into folder and install node modules
yarn install

# start project
yarn start

# now running on http://localhost:3000/
```
